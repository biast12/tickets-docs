# All Bot Permissions explained
***
For the Bot to work fully it needs many permissions.

Either you manually give it each needed permissions or you give it the `Administrator` permission which will just make it "work".  For an explanation of how to adjust permissions, [check the Discord help article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-How-do-I-set-up-Permissions).


Below is a rough explanation of what each permission is used for:


* `View Channels` "Allows the bot to view the content of a channel."

* `Manage Channels` "Allows the bot to create, rename, recategorize, and delete channels."

* `Manage Roles` "Allows the bot to create and edit roles, give and take away roles from users, and adjust a channel's role permissions."

* `Manage Webhooks` "Allows the bot to create webhooks for transcripts, and for staff to use the dashboard to send messages or tags in open tickets."

* `Send Messages` "Allows the bot to send messages in channels."

* `Send Messages in Threads` "Allows the bot to send messages in threads."

* `Create Public Threads` "Allows the bot to create public threads."

* `Create Private Threads` "Allows the bot to create private threads, such as thread mode tickets and the /notes command for channel tickets."

* `Embed Links` "Allows the bot to send ticket panels, welcome messages, and tags that include an embedded message."

* `Attach Files` "Allows the bot to assign the attach files permission to the ticket opener."

* `Add Reactions` "Allows the bot to add the buttons to ticket panels, welcome messages, and all commands that use buttons."

* `Use External Emojis` "Allows the bot to use non-server emojis in ticket panels, welcome messages, and tags. Bot must still be in the other server to use them."

* `Mention @Everyone` "Allows the bot to mention everyone, here and all roles in a ticket."

* `Manage Threads` "Allows the bot to create, rename, close, and delete threads."

* `Read Message History` "Allows the bot to read all messages in a channel."

* `Use Application Commands` "Allows the bot's slash commands to work."

* `Manage Channels` "Allows the bot to create ticket channels and modify them."

* `Manage Webhooks` "Allows the bot to create a webhook in the ticket channel used for sending messages from the Dashboard."

* `Pin Messages` "Allows the bot to pin the welcome message and its buttons on ticket creation."

These permissions are mandatory so that the Bot can work. Any other permission can be denied for the bot to use since those aren't used by the bot. 

> **Note:** The used Permissions can change when the bot gets a new update or feature.
